# @mybldr/ui

This repository houses an MUI-wrapper that is used as the base component library for myBLDR, and the various front-ends integrating with myBLDR.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install;
```

Now, you can run the Storybook server to view the components in action:

```bash
npm run storybook;
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the components in your web browser at `http://localhost:6006/`.
